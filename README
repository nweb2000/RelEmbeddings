Pipeline Process

-First create the word and relation dictionary. These give mappings from words/relations to indexes that enables one to 
create vector data from the tuples. Use python3 tuple_file rel_limit 
tuple_file is the text file containing the tuples, rel_limit is how many times a relation should appear in order to use it, we use 5

-Next create the sparse numpy arrarys containing the vector representation of the tuples using the previously created dictonaries
use python3 tuple_reader tuple_file
This creates a pickle file TupleFileOut containing the serialized object

-Next use the pretrained relation and word embeddings to create a preinitialized weight matrix for the final neural net model
python3 init_weights <word or rel dict> <init_edict_file> <init_embed_file> <outfile> <Use_Rels = yes or no>
